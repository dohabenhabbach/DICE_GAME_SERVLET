<h1 style="color:blue"> Dice Game Rules </h1><br>
<h4>Players will roll 3 dice, numbered 1 to 6, one at a time in any order. A player cannot roll the same die more than once during the game, or the game will end and the player will receive a score of -1. 
If the result obtained for die number 1 is strictly lower than the result obtained for die number 2 and the result obtained for die number 2 is strictly lower than the result obtained for die number 3, then the player receives a score equal to the sum of the results obtained for the 3 dices
If the result obtained for die number 1 is strictly higher than the result obtained for die number 2 and the result obtained for die number 2 is strictly higher than the result obtained for die number 3 then the player receives a score equal to the product results obtained for the 3 dices
Otherwise it receives a zero score
The application must stop the game once we can conclude about the score, for example if we get 5 for die number 1 and 6 for die number 2 then there is no point in waiting for the result of die number 3, because the score will be equal to 0 regardless of the result of the 3rd die </h4>
